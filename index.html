              business on tiresome and costly manual processes. The current
              software systems that existed was too costly and not fit for
              purpose.<br /><br />
              <b>The Solution</b><br /><br />
              We performed an in depth business process analyses on many used
              car dealerships in order to develop a cloud based system that
              manages used car dealerships in a paperless and autonomous

              A mining operation required an end to end operational performance
              reporting system. The solution needed to cover reporting for the
              entire value chain, and cater for easy data capture as well as
              weekly production reconciliation.<br /><br />
              <b>The Solution</b><br /><br />
              A mobile application to capture production data per shift was

              dashboard and reports, enabling viewing business performance on
              various metrics and time frames.<br /><br />
